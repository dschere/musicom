vexflow is a type script library for rendering music engravings
(music notation and tabiture)

great as it is, it does not have an event system so there is no way
to build an editor since you need to be able to have the music notation
respond to mouse events and to have other graphics rendered at key
positions.

All the rendering is in factory.ts and I made modifications for events
to be generated.

If the owners see fit to incorporate these changes, great I can use vexflow
as is otherwise I will need to build it myself. I don't want to fork on git
for a silly one module change.
